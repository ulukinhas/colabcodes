No one was injured. Gaseous hydrogen leaked into one of the support buildings from a high pressure hydrogen gas system consisting of two storage tanks and connecting pipes. A location at one pipe had been attacked by galvanic corrosion on the outer wall for some time, thinning the wall. However, the pipe was not routinely under pressure. Just before the explosion, an isolation valve failed open, permitting hydrogen under a pressure of ca. 30 MPa (4300 psig) to enter the pipe and break the thinned wall. Hydrogen from the two 19.8 cubic meter (700 cubic foot) tanks was released into one support building and into the next one. An electrical contact in a sump pump motor starter relay arced when the sump pump in the first building began an automatic start sequence. The electrical arc ignited the hydrogen in one building and this explosion apparently initiated an explosion in the other building.\"\n",

        "# - **event_description**: \"This resulted in the destruction of the building where the explosion occurred and claimed the lives of two people. The triggering event was a blowing out of a gasket in a water pump situated in a 100 m long, 10 m wide and 7 m high building. The pump fed water to a vessel that contained hydrogen gas at 30 bars. The pressure caused a back flow of water flow through the pump and out of the failed gasket. The hydrogen reached the leakage point after approximately 3 minutes. The discharge of gas lasted 20 - 30 seconds before the explosion. The total discharge of hydrogen inside the building was about 10 - 20 kg. Most likely a hot bearing ignited the gas cloud. The main explosion was very violent and it is likely that the gas cloud detonated. 3.5 - 7 kg of hydrogen must have been burning during the explosion.( No quantitative evidence that the cloud detonated, but from the damage observed, experience from other accidents and experiments detonation seems most likely). The roof of the building was lifted by an estimated 1.5 meters before resettling. The displacement of the roof caused a guillotine break of a 350 mm diameter pipe connected to the vessel that was the source of the original gas discharge. The gas composition in the vessel was 65 - 95 % hydrogen. This resulted in a large horizontal jet fire lasting about 30 seconds. Minor explosions occurred in the plant culvert system. The explosion caused large number of fragments representing a severe hazard. Glass windows were broken up to 700 m from the centre of the explosion. Within a radius of 100 m all ordinary windows were broken.\"\n",

        "# - **event_description**: \"An explosion occurred a the Lurgi electrolysis unit of a chemical factory. The plant suffered extensive damage and one man died. The electrolysis plant produced hydrogen for process use and oxygen as a waste product by electrolysis of potassium hydroxide solution. The investigation concluded that the explosion probably occurred on the oxygen separating drum into which hydrogen had leaked. After the accident the company carried out a mass balance on the hydrogen flows just prior to the explosion and found that no less than 50% was unaccounted for. The ingress of hydrogen into the oxygen drum was apparently due to corrosion/erosion in the electrolysis cells. The internal breakdown of the cells had probably been initiated some time before the accident. On April 2, a cracking noise was heard in the cell block, which may have indicated minor explosions. There was a system of monitoring the purity of the hydrogen and oxygen streams by hourly gas analyses performed by the process operator. The evidence suggested that these analyses were not always carried out and that assumed values were entered in the process log. One operator stated that he only did the analyses two or three times in every 12 h. The report on the accident by the HSE (1976b) estimated that on the basis of the explosion damage, the 1690 l oxygen drum contained a 13.5% hydrogen, 86.5% oxygen mixture, and the explosion produced a shock wave equivalent to 22 kg of TNT. It was calculated that this explosion would have caused an overpressure of 1.03 kPa at 220 m and of 0.21 kPa at 660 m on an open site. The factory was in an urban area with houses 180 m and a school 210 m from the electrolysis plant. Although on an open site some damage might be expected from an explosion of the size described at these distances, none actually occurred. Probably this was due to the fact that the electrolysis plant was housed in a building designed and constructed to direct any blast upward.\"\n",

Operator personnel arrived on the site at 18:30 and confirmed that hydrogen was present in the area.  The location was in an isolated area.  Manual isolation valves were shut to close in the segment and it was manually blown down. At 08:52 on of the day after the operator determined that the incident met reportable criteria and called the national response centre at 09:22. Blowdown of the isolated segment was completed at 12:30 on 6 may 2019. There was no immediately recognizable cause of the incident.  No excavators were operating in the area, and cathodic protection (CP) testing showed no abnormalities.  The suspected area of the leak was excavated, but the pipe was shown to be in excellent condition.  Upon further investigation, it was determined that the leak was most likely located underneath a small non-navigable drainage canal.  Unable to excavate under the water, a new segment of pipe was installed, rerouting around the leak. The pipeline was put back into service on 6 days later.\"\n",

The electrolysis cells had been restarted following a power outage that had occurred earlier, at the start of the storm. The fire was extinguished after approximately 3 hours, and the electrolysis unit was restarted. According to the ARIA report (see references) steam and nitrogen are injected to dilute the hydrogen stream and raise the minimum ignition energy of the hydrogen-oxygen mixture. However, this does not altogether eliminate the risk of ignition, because the hydrogen remains above the minimum ignition concentration.

When a water solution in an absorption tower for carbonic acid gas is drawn off, the water level of the solution drops. This drop \\\\was ignored and the pump cavitated. Since the pump and a transfer valve were not shut down immediately, hydrogen in the absorption tower flowed into the tank.

During the re-start phase of an electrolysis workshop in a chemical plant, chlorine (Cl2) gas leaked from a pipeline in a confined chlorine liquefaction unit, specifically at the pipeline carrying residual chlorine from the gas/liquid separator to a liquid bleach manufacturing plant. The leak took place when few tens of cm of this pipeline failed, due to the combustion of the pipeline steel by chlorine, which in turn was caused by the presence of hydrogen in the pipeline due to lack of monitoring. According to the rules, hydrogen concentration in the residual chlorine must remain below the 4.6 %vol value (the hydrogen low explosion limit, LEL).  It is manually controlled by the rate of evaporation of chlorine in the gas/liquid separator and monitored through analysis. During the accident, the technician failed to reduce the increasing hydrogen concentration in the pipeline that reached 6.7%, crossing the LEL. To bring down the concentration, the evaporation rate of chlorine was increased causing thus a rise in the residual chlorine flow rate. This probably provided the low energy needed to start combustion. The flame stabilised near a valve and a flow meter and caused the combustion of iron / chlorine when the temperature reached 130 °C.\"\n",

A control valve on the liquid line between the high- and the low-pressure separators was opened in error and the liquid allowed to drain. High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It over-pressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar. The explosion disintegrated the separator and also damaged other vessels and pipes. Released flammable substances were ignited resulting in jet-fires. The explosion occurred in the hydrocracker unit in which waxy oils reacted with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure in presence of a catalyst to form light petroleum spirits and gases (approximately 23 m3/h). The following substances were released from the LP separator after the explosion: hydrogen (1 tonne)). Petroleum Gases: (3 tonnes)), Hydrocarbon Liquids in released aerosol (10 tonnes)). The following substances were released from the nearby pipework and vessels damaged by the explosion: Light Petroleum Spirits ((190 tonnes). -Heavy Hydrocarbons Liquids (220 tonnes). 8 people were directly involved in the explosion and the subsequent fire (1 person was killed by explosion). The smoke from the fire did not affected the locality. The effects of the LP separator burst were equivalent to those of an explosion of 90 kg of TNT. The accident occurred because of an operator error (due to both the insufficient training of the operator and to the inappropriate procedures) in opening the control valve on the liquid line from the HP to the LP separator without noticing that the liquid contents in the HP vessel was draining away. Alarms did not operate because they had been previously disconnected without taking into account the decrease in safety. The main reason for the disconnection of the alarms was due to avoid operational difficulties because of the insufficient design capacity of the plant.\"\n",

A small amount of hydrogen gas continued to escape from the trailer tank and burn for almost eight hours, until a specialist of the truck delivery company arrived to manually shut off a critical valve. In the meantime, emergency response crews called to the scene sprayed water across the hydrogen tank as a precautionary cooling measure. As described in the PRESLHY report (see references), the driver had just terminated a first unloading of the tank. The manual valve connecting the trailer to stationary storage was apparently left in an open position after the first unloading. The driver next failed to perform the required procedure of seven purges intended to eliminate contaminants and water from the piping before connecting the hose for the second unloading. He then opened the pneumatic valve before connecting the hose, which, due to the open manual valve, resulted in a direct release of liquid hydrogen into the ambient air.

No one was injured. Gaseous hydrogen leaked into one of the support buildings from a high pressure hydrogen gas system consisting of two storage tanks and connecting pipes. A location at one pipe had been attacked by galvanic corrosion on the outer wall for some time, thinning the wall. However, the pipe was not routinely under pressure. Just before the explosion, an isolation valve failed open, permitting hydrogen under a pressure of ca. 30 MPa (4300 psig) to enter the pipe and break the thinned wall. Hydrogen from the two 19.8 cubic meter (700 cubic foot) tanks was released into one support building and into the next one. An electrical contact in a sump pump motor starter relay arced when the sump pump in the first building began an automatic start sequence. The electrical arc ignited the hydrogen in one building and this explosion apparently initiated an explosion in the other building.\"\n",

The triggering event was a blowing out of a gasket in a water pump situated in a 100 m long, 10 m wide and 7 m high building. The pump fed water to a vessel that contained hydrogen gas at 30 bars. The pressure caused a back flow of water flow through the pump and out of the failed gasket. The hydrogen reached the leakage point after approximately 3 minutes. The discharge of gas lasted 20 - 30 seconds before the explosion. The total discharge of hydrogen inside the building was about 10 - 20 kg. Most likely a hot bearing ignited the gas cloud. The main explosion was very violent and it is likely that the gas cloud detonated. 3.5 - 7 kg of hydrogen must have been burning during the explosion.( No quantitative evidence that the cloud detonated, but from the damage observed, experience from other accidents and experiments detonation seems most likely). The roof of the building was lifted by an estimated 1.5 meters before resettling. The displacement of the roof caused a guillotine break of a 350 mm diameter pipe connected to the vessel that was the source of the original gas discharge. The gas composition in the vessel was 65 - 95 % hydrogen. This resulted in a large horizontal jet fire lasting about 30 seconds. Minor explosions occurred in the plant culvert system. The explosion caused large number of fragments representing a severe hazard. Glass windows were broken up to 700 m from the centre of the explosion. Within a radius of 100 m all ordinary windows were broken.\"\n",

The electrolysis plant produced hydrogen for process use and oxygen as a waste product by electrolysis of potassium hydroxide solution. The investigation concluded that the explosion probably occurred on the oxygen separating drum into which hydrogen had leaked. After the accident the company carried out a mass balance on the hydrogen flows just prior to the explosion and found that no less than 50% was unaccounted for. The ingress of hydrogen into the oxygen drum was apparently due to corrosion/erosion in the electrolysis cells. The internal breakdown of the cells had probably been initiated some time before the accident. On April 2, a cracking noise was heard in the cell block, which may have indicated minor explosions. There was a system of monitoring the purity of the hydrogen and oxygen streams by hourly gas analyses performed by the process operator. The evidence suggested that these analyses were not always carried out and that assumed values were entered in the process log. One operator stated that he only did the analyses two or three times in every 12 h. The report on the accident by the HSE (1976b) estimated that on the basis of the explosion damage, the 1690 l oxygen drum contained a 13.5% hydrogen, 86.5% oxygen mixture, and the explosion produced a shock wave equivalent to 22 kg of TNT. It was calculated that this explosion would have caused an overpressure of 1.03 kPa at 220 m and of 0.21 kPa at 660 m on an open site. The factory was in an urban area with houses 180 m and a school 210 m from the electrolysis plant. Although on an open site some damage might be expected from an explosion of the size described at these distances, none actually occurred. Probably this was due to the fact that the electrolysis plant was housed in a building designed and constructed to direct any blast upward.\"\n",

No excavators were operating in the area, and cathodic protection (CP) testing showed no abnormalities.  The suspected area of the leak was excavated, but the pipe was shown to be in excellent condition.  Upon further investigation, it was determined that the leak was most likely located underneath a small non-navigable drainage canal.  Unable to excavate under the water, a new segment of pipe was installed, rerouting around the leak. The pipeline was put back into service on 6 days later.\"\n",

During the re-start phase of an electrolysis workshop in a chemical plant, chlorine (Cl2) gas leaked from a pipeline in a confined chlorine liquefaction unit, specifically at the pipeline carrying residual chlorine from the gas/liquid separator to a liquid bleach manufacturing plant. The leak took place when few tens of cm of this pipeline failed, due to the combustion of the pipeline steel by chlorine, which in turn was caused by the presence of hydrogen in the pipeline due to lack of monitoring. According to the rules, hydrogen concentration in the residual chlorine must remain below the 4.6 %vol value (the hydrogen low explosion limit, LEL).  It is manually controlled by the rate of evaporation of chlorine in the gas/liquid separator and monitored through analysis. During the accident, the technician failed to reduce the increasing hydrogen concentration in the pipeline that reached 6.7%, crossing the LEL. To bring down the concentration, the evaporation rate of chlorine was increased causing thus a rise in the residual chlorine flow rate. This probably provided the low energy needed to start combustion. The flame stabilised near a valve and a flow meter and caused the combustion of iron / chlorine when the temperature reached 130 °C.\"\n",

High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It over-pressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar. The explosion disintegrated the separator and also damaged other vessels and pipes. Released flammable substances were ignited resulting in jet-fires. The explosion occurred in the hydrocracker unit in which waxy oils reacted with hydrogen at high temperature and pressure in presence of a catalyst to form light petroleum spirits and gases (approximately 23 m3/h). The following substances were released from the LP separator after the explosion: hydrogen (1 tonne)). Petroleum Gases: (3 tonnes)), Hydrocarbon Liquids in released aerosol (10 tonnes)). The following substances were released from the nearby pipework and vessels damaged by the explosion: Light Petroleum Spirits ((190 tonnes). -Heavy Hydrocarbons Liquids (220 tonnes). 8 people were directly involved in the explosion and the subsequent fire (1 person was killed by explosion). The smoke from the fire did not affected the locality. The effects of the LP separator burst were equivalent to those of an explosion of 90 kg of TNT. The accident occurred because of an operator error (due to both the insufficient training of the operator and to the inappropriate procedures) in opening the control valve on the liquid line from the HP to the LP separator without noticing that the liquid contents in the HP vessel was draining away. Alarms did not operate because they had been previously disconnected without taking into account the decrease in safety. The main reason for the disconnection of the alarms was due to avoid operational difficulties because of the insufficient design capacity of the plant.\"\n",
